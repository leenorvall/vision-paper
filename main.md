# Mission & Vision

The Open Grid Alliance (OGA) seeks to be this organization. 
It will include leaders from multiple industries and disciplines, 
leveraging domain expertise that spans the entire stack, 
encompassing the physical infrastructure as well as the software-driven networking, virtualization, automation, application layers and sustainability.

# Introduction and Motivation

The Open Grid Alliance (OGA) started in Summer 2021 looking to catalyze the emergence of edge infrastructure, 5G networks and billions of connected IoT devices; the Open Grid is the next step in the evolution of the Internet. Globally distributed, the Open Grid weaves together a public and private fabric of compute, data and intelligence to enable contextually aware, immersive applications at the edge, on demand. The Open Grid is an architecture built on open principles that will enable the dynamic and geo-distribution of data and compute workloads, thus evolving the internet of today to service the billions of devices and applications for the internet of tomorrow. 

Since its inception 30+ members have joined the OGA to jointly realize the vision. 
The path to realize the vision will be enable through four workstreams 
namely the Think Tank, Innovation Zone, Industry Development and Market Development 
through interactions within OGA as well as the global related ecosystem.

# The Open Grid
The Open Grid is the inevitable evolution of the internet. Our legacy internet with its massively hyperscaled and centralized data centers and its core-centric network topologies will no longer provide for our needs; we must redesign our systems starting at the edge, augmenting today’s internet with new architectures that enable the rapid deployment of workloads and services to the right locations, for the right reasons, ensuring appropriate levels of latency, security, privacy, and resilience—and delivered at the right price, preferably at global scale. 

The Open Grid will be a software-defined system that stretches across the globe to support multi-cloud, hybrid cloud, near-prem and on-prem services via fungible resources that are employed, when and where they are needed, where data is created and consumed, on demand, and with enterprise SLAs. The Open Grid combines all the necessary components to support the next generation of scalable and distributed applications. It is the purposeful integration of hardware, software, networking, and infrastructure technologies to support the next generation of emerging applications.


# Call for Actions

The Open Grid can only come about through deep collaboration and open architectures. While many Grid technologies are being implemented today, it will be a decades-long journey of innovation and it will touch all levels of the stack, from fiber optics to AI-driven workload automation.
